  "content": "Have you ever felt guilty for staying indoors on a warm, sunny day? Then you might have fallen victim to “sunshine guilt.”While you might be familiar with seasonal affective disorder, which can cause feelings of depression and anxiety with the change of seasons, you likely associate the condition with colder months like fall or winter. However, some people actually experience depression and guilt during spring and summer. What is Sunshine Guilt?According to a 2024 survey by Forbes Health, nearly 50% of respondents said they’ve experienced summertime sadness. Lana Del Rey knows all about that one.This form of sadness, oftentimes referred to as “sunshine guilt,” typically packs feelings of remorse when cooped indoors on gorgeous weather days. Think of it as a form of “FOMO” (fear of missing out). You’re sitting in a cold, fluorescent-lit office, working the clear-skied, 80-degree day away. You open your Instagram for a quick distraction, only to see all your friends or influencers basking in the sun on the beach or on a long hike. You’re sure to feel a bit of depressive longing, right? “Sunshine guilt can originate from early childhood experiences relating to taking advantage of sunny weather and marking them as ‘special days,’ where core memories were formed,” Sabrina Romanoff, Psy.D., a Harvard-trained clinical psychologist and Forbes Health Advisory Board member, said in the Forbes summer depression survey. “Society tends to equate sunny weather with happiness, activity, and good memories. From marketing imagery, idealized movie scenes, to beach days—the sun primes us to get out and ‘seize the sunshine.’”Perhaps you feel guilty during the summer for seemingly wasting the day indoors. And if you live in an area that experiences the brutal shift of seasons, you likely also know the warm weather won’t last, which only adds to your dissatisfaction. On the other hand, though, some people experience this “summertime sadness” because of the scorching temperatures and humid conditions. The summer can be a bummer for those who prefer milder, cooler weather. Instead of heading outdoors to take advantage of daylight, you might prefer hiding in an air-conditioned room with the blinds pulled closed and autumn-scented candles burning.“The days are longer, there are higher levels of heat and humidity, and many people find the hot temperature oppressive,” Dr. Romanoff said in the Forbes survey. “On a societal level, due to media messaging and information from our personal social networks, we assume most people are out enjoying the sunshine. This could cause feelings of being ‘othered’ when our personal preferences to stay in and recharge appear so divergent from the general community.”The post Do You Experience Sunshine Guilt? appeared first on VICE.",

Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? A man facing charges after he allegedly lured a girl via social media was previously convicted of obtaining sex from a vulnerable teen who later killed herself. The Winnipeg Police Service’s counter-exploitation unit launched an investigation into the relationship between an Ontario man and a girl in her mid-teens in March. Investigators learned the suspect began communicating with the victim using private messaging on a social-media platform starting in December, the WPS said in a news release Wednesday. “As the relationship progressed, the suspect arranged to meet the victim in person,” police said. Officers found the pair in a home Friday, arrested the man and learned he had sexually assaulted her there, police said. Scott Christopher Alcorn, 49, of Red Lake, Ont., is charged with sexual assault; sexual interference; luring a person under 16 years; and making available, distributing or selling sexually explicit material to a person under 16. He was detained in custody. In December 2021, Manitoba’s highest court struck down a 15-month jail term for Alcorn and imposed a sentence of five years in prison for trading a 60-ounce bottle of rum for sex with an Indigenous girl. He was convicted in 2020 of one count of obtaining sexual services for consideration from a person under 18. His victim, who was 16 at the time of the 2015 offence, died by suicide in 2016. Court records described her as a high-risk youth with multiple mental health and addiction issues who traded sex to survive. Alcorn and the girl met over social media, and Alcorn agreed to give the girl a bottle of liquor in exchange for sex, court heard at trial. A secret recording of the pair having sex was made by a pimp and child pornographer who was sentenced to 21 years in prison for sexually exploiting the girl who died by suicide and five others. The Court of Appeal ruled Alcorn’s original sentencing judge erred by not treating the crime with the same gravity as other sexual offences against children. Alcorn applied for leave to appeal the increased sentence to the Supreme Court Canada but was denied in June 2022. fpcity@freepress.mb.ca Advertisement",

  "description": "Vanderpump previously faced backlash after she called Kennedy and Lewber's December 2024 disagreement and his subsequent arrest \"ridiculous.\"",
  "content": "Lisa Vanderpump condemned James Kennedy’s behavior after previously downplaying his domestic violence arrest . The “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” alum defended giving Kennedy “second chances” but clarified she has had a change of heart since his December 2024 detainment over an argument with then-girlfriend Ally Lewber. “I’ve had so much patience with him,” she told Us Weekly in an interview published Wednesday. “I was so happy to see him with Ally and doing so well. I know it’s a disease, but at some point, you’ve got to say, ‘I cannot support this anymore’ with some people when they keep making the same mistakes.” When asked if she’s “been in touch” with Kennedy, 33, since his arrest — and since he was cleared of domestic violence charges in January — Vanderpump, 64, explained that he “reached out” post-arrest, but she wanted to speak to Lewber, 29, first. “I did talk to Ally at great length, and she reassured me that nothing happened physically,” she recalled, calling the altercation “drunken nonsense.” Vanderpump previously faced backlash from fans and her former co-stars after she called Kennedy and Lewber’s disagreement and his subsequent arrest “ridiculous” in a February interview with the same outlet. “I needed to hear from Ally, too, from her mouth, what happened. She told me categorically he didn’t hurt her. He never hurts her. They were both drinking,” Vanderpump claimed of the night the duo got into a fight after attending Kathy Hilton’s annual holiday party . The restaurateur alleged the pair were “both being ridiculous and arguing” when a neighbor overheard and called the police. “She basically said, ‘Oh yes, take him away. It’ll teach him a lesson,’” Vanderpump said in February. “But no, he didn’t hurt her categorically. ... She regrets what happened with how this blew up.” Former “Vanderpump Rules” star — and Kennedy’s ex — Kristen Doute subsequently called Vanderpump “absolutely and disgustingly diabolical” for “enabling” his behavior. While Lewber never directly reacted to either comment, she recently revealed that Vanderpump allegedly tried to “convince” her to stay with Kennedy after the arrest. “She called me, and she did make sure, like, ‘Are you OK?’ I mean, this was, like, two months later, but she called and made sure ... maybe a month? I don’t know. Certainly not the next day,” Lewber said on an episode of the “Viall Files” podcast last week. The “StarStruck” podcast host explained that Vanderpump felt “very protective” and “motherly” towards Kennedy. “She was basically like, ‘Ally, he needs you. You’re really good together,’” Lewber claimed. “She was like, ‘You should go travel with him to his [DJ] shows this weekend.’ I’m like, ‘First of all, what shows? He’s canceled right now. And also, no? I just moved into an apartment. We’re not together.’” She admitted that Vanderpump’s comments initially made her feel “weak” and led her to “question” ending the relationship. However, Lewber remained firm and ultimately broke up with Kennedy after three years of dating. Although Lewber has gone on to clarify that she “was not hurt physically,” she did claim the DJ broke his sobriety and was “drinking behind [her] back.” In late January, Kennedy marked 48 days of sobriety with an Instagram Story selfie. If you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).",

  "description": "The man accused of setting fire to Pennsylvania's executive mansion early Sunday dialed 911 after the attack and suggested he was upset by Gov.",
  "content": "The man accused of setting fire to Pennsylvania's executive mansion early Sunday dialed 911 after the attack and suggested he was upset by Gov. Josh Shapiro's position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , according to newly released search warrants. Cody Balmer, 38, placed the call around 2:50 a.m., about 50 minutes after a fire was reported at the Governor's Residence in Harrisburg, the state police warrants say. He reportedly told a dispatcher that he \"will not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people,\" appearing to refer to Shapiro. Balmer then said he wanted to \"stop having my friends killed,\" according to the warrants, and told the dispatcher \"our people have been put through too much by that monster.\" It's unclear if he was referring to Shapiro, but the warrants said he also told the dispatcher that \"all he has is a banquet hall to clean up.\" Before ending the call, according to the warrants, Balmer said: \"You all know where to find me. I'm not hiding, and I will confess to everything that I had done.\" The warrants say the call demonstrates Balmer's \"political motivation for his conduct.\" The Pennsylvania State Police also asked the court to seize all electronic devices, writings or notes \"that contain any of the following: the name of Josh Shapiro, reference to Palestine, Gaza, Israel or the current conflict in Gaza.\" The attack at the Governor's Residence came hours after Shapiro hosted a Seder dinner and wished his followers on social media on Saturday a \"happy Passover,\" a major Jewish holiday. Balmer's social media presence suggests staunch anti-government views, including negative content about former President Joe Biden and memes urging people to \"become ungovernable.\" Shapiro, a Democrat and former Pennsylvania attorney general, assumed the governor's office in 2023. He has sharply condemned the rise of antisemitism , including at some pro-Palestinian protests, while also condemning Islamophobia. Balmer, of Penbrook, turned himself in to state police on Sunday afternoon, after authorities said he also told an ex-girlfriend about breaking into the governor's mansion. The woman also called police, they said. The Dauphin County District Attorney's Office announced charges of attempted criminal homicide, aggravated arson, burglary, terrorism and other counts. District Attorney Fran Chardo said on Monday that his office would review whether the suspect was motivated by politics or religion. Sunday's security breach at Shapiro's residence occurred while the family and other guests were asleep. According to a probable cause affidavit, Balmer scaled a perimeter fence, then used a hammer to smash through a window where he threw a homemade incendiary device made out of a beer bottle into a first-floor room, setting off a \"substantial fire.\" He then smashed a window of an adjacent room, entered and deployed a second device, according to the affidavit, before exiting the residence and fleeing. Balmer told police that had he encountered Shapiro, \"he would have beaten him with his hammer,\" the affidavit said, which added that \"Balmer admitted to harboring hatred\" toward Shapiro. The governor recounted during a news conference Sunday that he and his family awoke to the noise of a state trooper banging on their door. State police said the incident unfolded over \"several minutes,\" and that while security knew a breach had occurred on the sprawling property, the intruder managed to evade them while troopers went to ensure the governor's safety. No one was injured. Pennsylvania State Police said Wednesday that a third-party expert would conduct an independent security review of the incident. Balmer remains jailed after a judge on Monday denied him bail during a preliminary arraignment; he did not enter a plea. During his appearance, he rejected having a mental illness or requiring medication. \"That's the rumor, but no, ma'am,\" he told the judge. Balmer also said that he lives with his parents and was unemployed, but that his last job was as a welder at a truck body manufacturer. He added that he has \"a lot\" of children, and has previously been arrested, but \"missed a few\" court dates. Records show he was due to appear in court this week involving charges of simple assault related to a January 2023 domestic dispute. Penbrook police said they had responded to the home of Balmer's then-wife, after a child called 911 to say his stepfather was assaulting his mother. Balmer \"advised that he had taken a bottle full of pills in an attempt to kill himself,\" the complaint said. He began arguing with his wife, and then shoved her 13-year-old son when the child intervened, the complaint added. Balmer was accused of physically assaulting his wife, her son and another 10-year-old son. The court hearing this week was continued in light of his arrest, court officials said. Over the years, Balmer had also pleaded guilty to forgery and theft in 2015 and again to forgery in 2016. He did hold a steady job for several years as a mechanic. Dipesh Modi, the owner of Kindermans Auto Repair in Harrisburg, said \"nothing stood out\" about Balmer, and their parting in 2022 was \"mutual.\" But Balmer's mother said she was concerned about his mental health in recent days, and told The Associated Press on Monday that he was not taking his medication and that \"nobody would help\" when she called authorities last week. Penbrook police Lt. Jesse Foltz confirmed the department did receive a call from Balmer's mother on Thursday asking for help for her son after he left the family's home. But Foltz said that because Baumer hadn't articulated any actual threats to himself or others, police could not hold him for an involuntary mental health evaluation. Balmer's mother also told police she tried getting help from the local crisis intervention office, and that her son became upset because she called them. The office did not return a request for comment. Balmer's mother and his ex-girlfriend who called police following the arson attack also didn't respond to requests for comment. Shapiro on Wednesday made his first public appearance since the weekend at an opening of a new Hershey Company manufacturing plant. He alluded to the attack in his remarks. \"I think it is particularly good and meaningful for me to be here today, given the events of this past weekend, to celebrate the growth of this iconic company,\" he said. \"I know it's easy to look at the world and see the people who are trying to tear things down.\"",

Michelle, a heartbroken twenty-something, becomes the target of The Duchess, an archdemon with thigh-high boots and a threatening allure. Marked as The Duchess’ love interest and cursed with a powerful Third Eye, Michelle has a limited amount of time to discover why she’s been chosen and how to escape the curse with her life intact. The game plays out in a fixed-camera perspective for exploration scenes, and switches to a dual-stick, first-person view for combat. Transitioning between third and first person feels nice and smooth, and the game does a great job of infusing classic Resident Evil -style gameplay with modern sensibilities. Characters in Sorry We’re Closed are raw, funny and authentic, and their relationships are relatably messy. The city is populated by a diverse blend of genders and sexualities, and it feels both perfectly natural and deeply welcoming, like a stunning fever dream of what could be if The Gay Agenda finally got its way. Sorry We’re Closed is campy, relatable, gruesome and gorgeous — just like The Duchess. — Jessica Conditt, Senior Reporter $25 at Steam Konami Silent Hill 2 Silent Hill 2 is as horrifying as it is depressing . The 2001 game gave us some of the most recognizable enemies not just in the series but in horror gaming at large: the homicidal sexy nurses and Pyramid Head. But it’s the psychological elements and unsettling atmosphere that really cement its creep-factor. The 2024 remake feels even more in-your-face about it all, as if everything scary about the game has been ramped up a few notches. As in the original, you play as James Sunderland, who has traveled to Silent Hill in search of his (dead?) wife, only to discover a hostile ghost town. I did not relax for a single moment over the course of my first playthrough. That’s mostly due to the game’s incredible sound design, which creates an atmosphere of ever-increasing tension until it’s almost unbearable. In areas like the prison, the cacophony of frightening sounds in the dark — galloping horses, metallic clanging, creatures scuttling — had me so on edge I found myself having to step away from the game a few times and get some air. It really gets under your skin. The Silent Hill 2 remake leans more into combat than the original, and the enemies are abundant. They lurk around corners, crowd narrow hallways, drop from the ceiling; there’s no avoiding them. They’re even unnerving when they’re not doing anything but staring you down from the end of a dark hallway (one particular Pyramid Head moment comes to mind here). There are plenty of startling encounters, too, which made me scream an embarrassing number of times. As a horror fan, this is exactly the experience I was looking for. And, without getting into any spoilers, it could be argued that the scariest thing about Silent Hill 2 is not the monsters, but the dark sides of human nature that it exposes. If you want a game that will leave you thoroughly freaked out, you really can’t go wrong with this one. — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend Editor $70 at Steam Studio Seufz The Longing Partway between a point-and-click adventure and an idle game, The Longing is a soulful, often darkly comedic reflection on solitude, patience, and really, life itself. You play as a small, sooty-looking servant called the Shade, who serves a titanic king, alone and deep underground. As the king enters an uninterruptible sleep, he commands you to wake him in 400 days, at which point he will end all fear and longing in the world. A timer then appears at the top of the screen, and the 400 days start to elapse in real time, even when the game is closed. What happens from there is up to you. You can wait the actual year-plus and see what happens. You can defy your orders and seek the outside world. You can simply exist somewhere in between, reading public-domain books, decorating your underground home, exploring the caverns, taking your time. No matter what, the clock keeps ticking, each second its own decision. To call The Longing an acquired taste would be an understatement: It is glacially slow by design, with no enemies to fight or dense gameplay systems to sink into. But few games are as provocative or singularly focused as a result. It’s the kind of project that makes you wonder why more video games aren’t so audacious. — Jeff Dunn, Senior Reporter $15 at GOG 11 bit studios INDIKA INDIKA is a visceral game. It’s a (mostly) third-person narrative adventure set in an alternative 19th century Russia, and it stars an ostracized nun, Indika, who has the devil’s voice in her head. From this foundation, the game offers a flurry of whimsical absurdity, religious criticism and raw human suffering, always with a wink and a nod. The entire game is underpinned by a delirious tension between levity and agony, and the developers at Odd Meter got the balance just right. Indika’s reality is a frozen hellscape filled with pain and isolation, but she also encounters laugh-out-loud moments that make the experience feel more like a rom-com than a psychodrama about a sad nun. The game also slips into a lighter visual style as it delves into Indika’s past, mining memories out of pixelated platformers in sun-drenched environments. INDIKA is a masterful example of maturity in video games. That said, it includes scenes of sexual violence — though they’re handled delicately and don’t feel exploitative. INDIKA thrives in the messy area between pleasure and discomfort, and it’s worth a play for anyone seeking something completely original. — J.C. $25 at GOG Simogo / Annapurna Interactive Lorelei and the Laser Eyes Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is a third-person noir detective game set in a haunted hotel with impossible architecture and a gruesome history. Its hallways are dense with logic-melting puzzles about magicians, mazes, astrology, filmmaking, mausoleums and physics, and it isn’t even clear why the protagonist is there in the first place. With artifacts from the 1800s, set pieces from the 1960s and technology out of the 2010s, it’s barely clear when she’s there. Lack of direction is a key tenet of the game, resulting in a sense of solitude that’s deliciously unsettling. It’s also empowering. The hotel in Lorelei is a playground of secrets with no set path for players, and there’s a rich density of riddles and lore to untangle in every scene. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is horrific and emotionally powerful, and its visual vibe is “David Lynch does Kentucky Route Zero .” The entire thing is deeply, endlessly satisfying as a puzzle-solving experience. For lovers of riddles and psychological terror, this is one of the best games of the generation. — J.C. $25 at Steam Red Barrels The Outlast Trials The Outlast Trials draws from dark and true stories of government-backed inhumanity, religious manipulation and capitalistic greed in the 20th century. Trials is a cooperative, four-person horror experience where players are trapped in a secret facility run by the Murkoff Corporation. The goal is to graduate therapy (with your friends), complete objectives and survive monstrous villains in various maps, including an orphanage, courthouse, police station and toy factory. As in the original Outlast titles, gameplay mainly involves running and hiding from prowling, deranged sadists, though this time you’re not alone. Trials is a living game and its developer, Red Barrels, is churning out new content on a regular basis. The entire Outlast universe is worth exploring, and most of it can be tackled solo. The original Outlast and its Whistleblower DLC are modern horror classics, introducing the series’ iconic night vision mechanic and injecting players with a deep sense of helplessness while they try to escape the monsters of Mount Massive Asylum. Outlast 2 takes the terror to the Arizona desert, where a doomsday cult is on a murder and torture spree. These original games are first-person, single-player experiences fraught with tension and battery hunting, and they’re all essential plays for horror-game fans. — J.C. $40 at Steam Cardboard Computer Kentucky Route Zero Kentucky Route Zero is a game vaguely about a road trip through the heart of Americana — not America, but the very idea of the United States. It’s more of an interactive art installment than a familiar adventure or exploration game, with slender characters traveling through a shadowy world of magical realism. It's mysterious and slightly dangerous, and it rewards gentle curiosity with heartfelt human stories. It’s odd. Mostly, though, it’s beautiful. Kentucky Route Zero was once a game trapped in purgatory. Created by members of an art collective, it rolled out over the course of nine years, revealed in 2011 and its final installment landing in 2020. The original release cadence was fitting for the game itself — disjointed yet perfectly seamless — but players today have the unique pleasure of being able to devour it all at once, closing the loop in one fell swoop. The thing is, Kentucky Route Zero is the kind of game that never really ends. It lives on in the subconscious in little snippets of music, monochromatic vignettes and haunting dialogue, and a feeling of bittersweet nostalgia that never truly dissipates once you’ve hit play. — J.C. $25 at GOG Xbox Game Studios Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Hellblade II is more of an extended, extremely anxious and violent vibe than a traditional adventure game. Its combat is OK, its puzzles verge on tedious and it’s emotionally one-dimensional — but as an interactive brutality visualizer, Hellblade II is outstanding. Senua fights until her pores ooze blood, screaming through each swing of her sword as whispers fill her head, cuing her when to strike and telling her to ignore the pain. Every fight is close-up and one-on-one, warriors waiting in a circle of fog for their turn to rush in, punch her in the face and slice her to pieces. The sounds of flesh smacking against flesh join the whispers and the screen splatters red when Senua is hit. Hellblade II revels in physical violence. And here’s the thing — it is absolutely beautiful. Hellblade II is a third-person narrative adventure set in Iceland in the 10th century, and it’s the sequel to Ninja Theory’s 2017 game, Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice . Senua is a young warrior who hears a cacophony of disembodied voices in her mind, judging her every move. The whispers are a critical and permanent part of Senua’s psyche — a lesson she learned in the first game, after realizing the depths of her father’s abuse when she was a child. In Hellblade II , Senua is figuring out how to live outside of her father’s influence, but his voice still rumbles in her head at inopportune times, drowning out the softer whispers that she’s come to view as her allies. Hellblade II is the perfect game for a quiet afternoon when you’re craving a dark sensory overload. — J.C. $50 at Amazon Lucas Pope Return of the Obra Dinn In Return of the Obra Dinn , you're put aboard a ship, alone. There is, however, a corpse near the captain's cabin. As you track the deceased's final footsteps, leading to yet more gruesome ends, you need to figure out what happened. Who killed who? And who is still alive? Return of the Obra Dinn is an unforgettable ghost-story-slash-murder-mystery with a distinctive old-school graphical style. It's unlike any game we've played in a long while, with a low-key musical score and a style of puzzle solving that's like unraveling one extended, satisfying, grisly riddle. Special mention to the sound effect that kicks in every time you solve the fates of three of the crew. Goosebumps . — Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief $20 at Steam Night Signal Entertainment Home Safety Hotline Picture this: It’s the 1990s and you’ve just started a new job as a telephone operator answering calls about mysterious home pests and hazards. You’re tasked with properly diagnosing each issue and providing remedies to the concerned callers. Easy, right? Well, what if some of the problems were caused by poltergeists, boggarts, goblins and something called “bed teeth?” And what if a misdiagnosis could result in an entire family being drained of life by otherworldly forces? Yeah, that’s more like it. Home Safety Hotline provides players with a ’90s computer interface and a growing list of house hazards, some standard and some paranormal, and the goal is to accurately pinpoint the pests and provide remedies to a string of callers. Your boss is on your ass the entire time and computer glitches remove your access to hazard descriptions at random intervals, which turns this into a game of identification, memorization and gut feelings. It gets pretty tricky. Home Safety Hotline is the perfect game to play at your desk, on the PC, so you can let the retro interface fully engulf your senses. — J.C. $15 at Steam Capcom Resident Evil Village Resident Evil Village is delightful. It’s a gothic fairy tale masquerading as a survival-horror game, and while this represents a fresh vibe for the franchise, it’s not an unwelcome evolution. The characters and enemies in Village are full of life — even when they’re decidedly undead — and Capcom has put a delicious twist on the idea of vampires, werewolves, sea creatures, giants and creepy dolls. The game retains its horror, puzzle and action roots, and it has Umbrella Corporation’s fingerprints all over it. It simply feels like developers had fun with this one, and so will you. And, yes, this is the one with the tall vampire lady . — J.C. $20 at Amazon The Chinese Room / Secret Mode Still Wakes the Deep In Still Wakes the Deep , horror comes in multiple forms. Eldritch creatures stalk the Beira D oil rig on thin, too-long limbs that burst from their bodies like snapping bungee cords. Human-sized pustules and bloody ribbons grow along the corridors, emitting a sickly cosmic glow. The North Sea is an unrelenting threat, wailing beneath every step. And then there’s the rig itself, a maze-like industrial platform supported by slender tension legs in the middle of a raging ocean, groaning as it’s ripped apart from the inside. Gameplay in Still Wakes the Deep is traditional first-person horror fare, executed with elegance and expertise by The Chinese Room. Its action involves leaping across broken platforms, balancing on ledges, running down corridors, climbing ladders, swimming through claustrophobic holes, and hiding from monsters in vents and lockers. There are no guns on the Beira D, and the protagonist has just a screwdriver to help him break open locks and metal panels, placing the focus on pure survival rather than combat. The game is fully voice acted and its crew members — most of them Scottish — are incredibly charming, which only makes the carnage more disturbing once the monsters board the rig. Still Wakes the Deep is an instant horror classic. It’s filled with heart-pounding terror and laugh-out-loud dialogue, and it all takes place in a setting that’s rarely explored in interactive media. Amid the sneaking, swimming, running and climbing, Still Wakes the Deep manages to tell a heartfelt story about relationships and sacrifice. — J.C. $35 at Steam Electronic Arts Dead Space The Dead Space remake feels like a warm, juicy hug from a murderous necromorph, and we mean that in the best way possible. The 2023 version of Dead Space spit-shines the mechanics that made the original game so magically horrific back in 2008, and it doesn’t add any unnecessary, modern bloat. The remake features full voice acting, new puzzles and expanded storylines, and it introduces a zero-gravity ability that allows the protagonist, Isaac Clarke, to fly through sections of the game in an ultra-satisfying way. None of these additions outshine the game’s core loop: stasis, shoot, stomp . Isaac gains the ability to temporarily freeze enemies and he picks up a variety of weapons, but he never feels overpowered; he’s always in danger. Mutilated corpse monsters appear suddenly in the cramped corridors of the space station, charging at Isaac from the shadows, limbs akimbo and begging to be shot off. The first game of Dead Space popularized the idea that headshots don’t matter and the remake stays true to this ethos – yet its combat rhythm still feels fresh. The 2023 version of Dead Space proves that innovative game design is timeless (and so are plasma cutters). — J.C. $13 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $26 at Macy's $50 at HSN AMC Games The Fabulous Fear Machine The Fabulous Fear Machine is a cheeky, real-time strategy game about using terror to gain ultimate power. It’s a heady topic presented in a pulp-horror style, with a magical fortune-telling automaton, exaggerated stakes and dramatic noir dialogue softening the narrative’s serious edge. Think Tales from the Crypt , but with propaganda and disinformation as the target subject. Gameplay-wise, it’s a blend of Plague Inc. and Cultist Simulator — each round is set on a bright world map, zoomed in to the appropriate cluster of countries. After planting a seed of terror in one spot, players help it spread by dispatching agents to major cities, collecting information, and then dropping Legends cards there, cultivating dark myths and conspiracy theories based on local beliefs. Spreading chaos and terror — and maybe making some money along the way — is the goal. It’s kitsch, it’s camp, and at times it makes you pause and say, huh . Put simply, it’s fabulous . — J.C. $18 at GOG.com Team Salvato Doki Doki Literature Club! Doki Doki Literature Club! looks like any other high-school dating sim, with your main character wooing the girl of his choice from among three options: the cheerful best friend, the quiet geeky lady and the nasty but secretly nice freshman. Your courtship is conducted by writing poems, angling your word choices toward the girl you hope to end up with. It seems straightforward — but when the girls start providing their own works of poetry, the cracks start to show. They’re weird. They’re unsettling. And the game only gets more distressing — like, deeply, soul-shatteringly disturbing — from there. In visual novels, you're supposed to make choices and have those decisions matter. Sometimes you're wrong and you fail, but you try again. In Doki Doki Literature Club! , the choices are always wrong. You're always going to fail. The game will emotionally abuse you as long as you continue to play. It will even break down the fourth wall to do it, something that made me scream, even though I knew the entire time it was just a game. — Kris Holt, Contributing Reporter $0 at Steam Tensori POOLS POOLS is the physical manifestation of the word “oppressive.” It’s less of a game and more of an interactive experience where every room and every turn is designed to increase your feelings of discomfort — even though it’s really just a bunch of pools. Gameplay involves walking through a cavernous, M.C. Escher-esque building of hyper-realistic wet rooms, traveling down dark corridors and wading through waters of various depths. It might sound lame, but this game is incredibly effective at producing feelings of claustrophobia and mortal peril. It’s also strangely gorgeous. POOLS is a beautiful and unsettling immersive experience. It feels like something that was plucked directly out of my nightmares — and maybe yours, too. — J.C. $10 at Steam SFB Games Crow Country In Crow Country , you play as Mara Forest, who must painstakingly make her way through an abandoned amusement park in the year 1990 to find its elusive and corrupt owner, Edward Crow. Resources, like ammo and health kits, must be scavenged. Skinless monstrosities may emerge from the shadows at any turn to grab at you and puzzles of varying complexity promise to stall your progress. There is an ensemble of characters who — including the protagonist — each seem to have questionable motives. There's no question about Crow Country ’s PlayStation 1 influences, which its creators at SFB Games have been upfront about: It is very intentionally the creepy-cute child of Resident Evil , Silent Hill and Final Fantasy VII . The game just about checks all the boxes for survival horror, but it takes a gentler approach to the genre, making it feel more like a test of mental endurance against some all-consuming bleakness than a constant fight for your life. — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend Editor $20 at Steam Devolver Digital Inscryption At its core, Inscryption is a roguelike deck-builder that's dripping with horror. You'll sacrifice certain animal-based cards to play more powerful ones against your opponent, and there are secrets to uncover in the room outside of the card game itself. There's so much more to it than that, though this is definitely one of those games where the less you know about it going in, the better. It's not too much of a spoiler to say things get pretty strange. Inscryption will absolutely mess with your expectations. — K.H. $20 at Steam Check out our entire Best Games series including the best Nintendo Switch games , the best PS5 games , the best Xbox games , the best PC games and the best free games you can play today.",

  "description": "At a Greater Vancouver Board of Trade event, candidates for the Liberals, Conservatives and NDP spar over how to deal with Trump",
  "content": "“We will never trust the United States in the same way that we did in the past.” That declaration from Liberal candidate Jonathan Wilkinson set the tone at a Greater Vancouver Board of Trade event Monday, where candidates debated how to handle growing trade tensions with the U.S. — and whether Canada’s future lies in looking beyond its largest trading partner. Wilkinson, who represented North Vancouver–Capilano in the last government, said that although Ottawa will continue to work and trade with the U.S. due to geography, given what has transpired, Canada won’t be as trusting or reliant on trade with that country. He cited Prime Minister Mark Carney’s visit to France and the U.K. for his first overseas trip in mid-March, saying Canada will have to enhance trade with more reliable partners and be more strategic diversifying trade. “We have free trade agreements with over 50 countries. ...We need to be thinking about how we can better match Canadian products with international needs,” he said. “The Liberal government will inject $5 billion into a trade diversification order to address bottlenecks like the Massey tunnel and the port.” Iain Black, the Conservative Party candidate for Coquitlam–Port Coquitlam, said at the event that change is desperately needed in Canada, adding the country cannot afford another Liberal term amid a stalling economy. He said a Conservative government can be trusted to drive down taxes, meaningfully cut red tape, create housing and bring back investment. Black also said his party would stand up to U.S. President Donald Trump from a position of strength. “As Conservatives, we will work to end the tariffs on day one after the election,” he said. “No one controls Donald Trump. What we can do, however, is better control Canada’s fate.” He said this would be done by reversing economic policies of that last Liberal government. Black also pointed out the issues of rising housing costs and a slow-growing GDP over the last 10 years. “Let us not forget that while the federal levels were systematically dismantling all the industries in this country, they found time to attack the small business community, too,” he said. “Without any consultation or warning, the Liberals tried to force down your throats a punishing and tone-deaf overhaul of the small business tax code that had been honoured for four decades.” Vanessa Sharma, NDP candidate for Cloverdale–Langley City, said at the event the Liberals and Conservatives have little to show after decades in power as the cost of living squeezes Canadians. She highlighted her party’s plan to improve affordability and to train 100,000 skilled workers to ramp up housing production and fill labour gaps in sectors like health. Sharma said the NDP would implement dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs, banning American companies from federal procurement and prioritizing Canadian materials in public projects. Meanwhile, Wilkinson also said getting rid of interprovincial trade barriers could boost Canada’s GDP by four per cent or $80 billion, as estimated by the International Monetary Fund. The Business Council of Alberta estimates that interprovincial trade barriers are equivalent to a 6.9 per cent tariff on Canadian goods. “It is important for Canadians to have confidence in the prime minister ... to manage what will be challenging times,” said Wilkinson. “And here, the choice you are being offered is stark.” He said Carney has senior economic experience in the public and private sectors, while Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has sat in the House of Commons for 20 years. “He is the epitome of a career politician. He has never worked in the private sector,” Wilkinson said. Black said unleashing Canada’s resources was also needed to boost the economy, as well as revoking some legislation from the current government to expedite the construction of critical energy infrastructure. “I think one of the biggest flaws in the narrative right now when it comes to dealing with President Trump is that this is an economic discussion,” said Black. “It’s not, this is bare-knuckle politics.” He said Poilievre is someone who has experience in politics, diplomacy and the parliamentary system, and who’s been preparing for this moment his entire life. Wilkinson added a reset is needed mentally, saying the government’s job is to pave the way and get out of the way. “And right now, the government is in the way,” he said. Sharma said the NDP plans to build three million homes by 2030 and unlock more land for construction. Federal leaders are set to debate in French Wednesday and debate in English Thursday.

  "description": "The bustling lobby of the Queens Criminal Courthouse at 125-01 Queens Blvd. With psychiatric beds scarce, attorneys are filing emergency court orders to move mentally unfit defendants out of Rikers faster — but critics say the system is nearing collapse. [ more › ]",
  "content": "The city's pipeline to get criminal defendants access to mental health care has become so clogged that defense lawyers have quietly developed backdoor legal maneuvers to get their defendants to the front of the line. But the workarounds, they warned, are a short-term fix that will collapse if more lawyers begin using them and the number of psychiatric beds stays stagnant. Gothamist previously reported that the number of people found mentally unfit to stand trial has more than doubled citywide since 2020, while available treatment beds increased by less than 10%. State and city officials have proposed adding beds both on and off Rikers Island. But these solutions require legislative approval. In the meantime, lawyers have tried a range of different strategies to get their clients to the front of the line. Mental health experts said the legal maneuvers demonstrate a criminal justice system buckling under pressure, and they questioned their fairness. \"The justice or lack thereof, I don't think is on the part of the lawyer. I think it's the lack of ability of these systems to efficiently and effectively and safely move people through these processes,\" said Evan Auguste, a clinical and forensic psychologist who has worked at New York's psychiatric hospitals. Auguste compared the legal maneuvering to “sweeping sand in the desert” and said mental health care in the criminal justice system is in need of reform. After someone has been charged with a crime in New York City, their defense lawyer can typically request a mental health evaluation to determine if the defendant is fit to stand trial. The evaluation assesses whether defendants can understand the court process and the charges against them. Based on the results, they are deemed either \"fit\" or \"unfit\" to proceed with their case. If found unfit, defendants are supposed to be transferred to the custody of the state Office of Mental Health, where they would receive treatment to restore their mental capacity enough to understand their court proceedings. But because the number of beds at state psychiatric hospitals has stagnated while the number of people found unfit has increased, there is nowhere for them to go. This leaves defendants with mental illness waiting on Rikers Island for months. The average wait time was 79 days as of last fall, according to a recent report from the Independent Rikers Commission . To circumvent these delays, defense attorneys have developed several legal strategies. One is filing special \"forthwith\" orders with the court, which asks judges to demand that the state immediately admit their client and start treating them. New York County Defender Services said their lawyers now file these “forthwith” orders for all of their clients found unfit to stand trial. \"What ends up happening is that if you have an order, you go to the top of the queue,\" said Chris Boyle, director of data research and policy for New York County Defender Services. \"The clients we get orders for tend to be moved quicker.” Organizations have tried other approaches with varying success. Some have tried suing the state through what’s known as an “Article 78,” which claims the government isn’t fulfilling its proper role. Lawyers have also undertaken special court proceedings that attempt to hold the Office of Mental Health in contempt of court for not accepting defendants promptly. Yung-Mi Lee, a lawyer with Brooklyn Defender Services, said the Office of Mental Health hasn’t been clear on why New York City residents are only placed in two downstate hospitals and not treated at other hospitals where there may be more room. \"It's not just my office — defense lawyers are engaging in litigation,” she said, “to try to get the Office of Mental Health to be more transparent in their decision-making.” The state’s Office of Mental Health said it is attempting to expand capacity in response to what it called a “substantial increase” in the number of people deemed unfit to stand trial. “When someone jumps the queue for services due to a court order, this will delay admission for others who have been waiting longer,” spokesperson Justin Mason said. Defense lawyers and experts largely agreed. The Legal Aid Society said it has also attempted to hold the state in contempt of court. But Elena Landriscina, a lawyer with Legal Aid Society, said these legal maneuvers aren't a solution. \"By bringing one person to the front of the line, inevitably you're putting another client — who can very well be another client of ours — further down the line,\" she said. Boyle said these approaches aren’t sustainable if all lawyers start looking for ways to jump the line. \"At some point, if we're filing orders on everybody — which eventually we'll get to do — we'll just be back in the same position again, because the Office of Mental Health can't handle that number of people,\" he said Auguste said lawyers maneuvering to cut the line also hurts defendants with limited English proficiency. He recalled one of his patients during an interview with Gothamist. \"She can't strategize with a lawyer in the same way,” he said. “In this question of justice that we're talking about, she’s not going to be able to jump the line. She's going to be caught in the system.\"",

To get it in your inbox, subscribe here . Looming Medicaid cuts could hurt maternal health. getty T he House of Representatives and the Senate both agreed to a budget framework over the weekend. The framework calls for spending cuts to pay for tax cuts that disproportionately go to the rich and funds to prevent rising deficits while also increasing spending for Trump’s deportations and other policy priorities. It’s widely expected that Medicaid, which provides health insurance to people with low incomes, will be significantly impacted–up to $880 billion over the next 10 years, about a 29% cut. Some of those cuts involve potential changes to Medicaid work requirements, which could remove insurance coverage from as many as five million people . That’s likely to mean less revenue for hospitals, particularly in rural areas, where about 19% of patients are on Medicaid. Family caregivers and long-term care for elderly Americans are also likely to be hit. Another area where Medicaid cuts threaten harm is maternal healthcare. The combination of Medicaid budget cuts, as well as those made to health services by DOGE , could particularly harm the health of women and children. Medicaid pays for more than 40% of all births in the country and covers more than one in four women aged 15 to 49. Andrea Ippolito, Founder of Simplifed, a startup that provides telehealth support for pregnancy and postpartum care, told Forbes that cuts to Medicaid would not only immediately impact the health of women and children, but also cost the healthcare system more in the long run. “If we don’t serve them, that’s just going to lead to folks showing up in the ER, to hospitalizations. It’s going to cause significant strain on the system and those costs will increase.” Ippolito also noted that many maternal health outcomes have gotten worse over the past decade, including mood disorders and gestational diabetes, and that cuts to Medicaid may exacerbate this. “One of the major drivers of this is because many folks aren’t attending that six-week postpartum visit or in general accessing postpartum care,” she said. “We need to improve access to care to improve health outcomes and ultimately be able to contain costs.” Kailera CEO Ron Renaud Albie Colantonio for Forbes In the summer of 2023, Dr. Amir Zamani, a 42-year-old Johns Hopkins–trained physician who is a partner on Bain Capital’s life sciences team in Boston, was obsessed with obesity drugs. Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic was taking America by storm, and Eli Lilly was nearing FDA approval for Zepbound. He’d spent months digging through reams of data from dozens of companies when he struck gold in an unexpected place: the portfolio of Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals, one of China’s biggest pharmaceutical companies. “It was like, ‘Wait a second, they’re ahead of everybody else who’s not Novo or Lilly,’ ” Zamani told Forbes. Results from Phase II clinical trials in China ultimately showed 59% of participants lost 20% or more of their body weight on an eight-milligram dose of the drug in 36 weeks, and side effects were mild. If those results hold, the drug could be especially useful for severely obese patients who need to lose more weight than they can on currently available medications. It used to be that Chinese drug development was largely about creating “me too” drugs for the local market. But over the past 10 years, with Beijing focused on building a native biotech industry, U.S.-trained Chinese scientists returned home and started innovating instead of mimic­king. American outfits have spent $8.1 billion on upfront payments for Chinese drugs between 2020 and 2024, compared to $536 million in the preceding five years, according to biopharma deals database DealForma. Zamani partnered with Atlas Venture and RTW Investments, and the three firms inves­ted $400 million to spin up Kailera Therapeutics in October, launching with a license for the four Hengrui therapies and a plan to shepherd them to market. To run Kailera, the investors hired an all-star: Ron Renaud, a 56-year-old former biotech stock analyst with a nearly unequaled track record of building biotech startups and then selling them for big profits.

Last week, the FDA approved the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, developed by Bristol Myers Squibb, for both liver cancers and colorectal cancers that can’t be treated surgically or have spread to other parts of the body. The two drugs work together to block different mechanisms that prevent tumors from being recognized by the immune system, which helps the body fight them off. In clinical trials, the combination therapy reduced disease progression or death in colorectal cancer patients by 79% compared to chemotherapy. In liver cancer, the risk of death was reduced by 21% compared to the current standard of care. When Dr. David Reese, Amgen’s first chief technology officer, set about hiring a head of artificial intelligence last year, he looked at people who’d worked in consumer products, finance and other areas. He ended up finding one in shoes. Last August, he brought on Sean Bruich, who’d spent the past 11 years of his career working at Nike, as senior vice president for AI and data, a move that might seem almost laughably incongruous. Like both its peer Big Pharma companies and smaller biotech startups, Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen is counting on AI to both speed up the process of drug discovery and make its operations more efficient. But most of the best data scientists aren’t working in healthcare–at least not yet. “Most of the talent [in AI] lies outside biopharma, not within it,” Reese told Forbes. Medtech company Science Corp., founded by Neuralink cofounder Max Hodak, has raised a $104 million investment round led by Khosla Ventures, according to Bloomberg . The company is developing a variety of technologies related to the brain, including brain-computer interfaces. It also has developed a retinal implant for treating blindness related to diseases such as macular degeneration that helped restore visual acuity in a recent clinical trial of 38 patients. Medical large language models make decisions based on socioeconomic factors, not just medical necessity, according to a new study published in Nature Medicine. The study’s researchers presented identical clinical symptoms to AI models, but supplied it each time with different demographic information about the patient. They found that the AI models suggested better care for white, wealthy patients–and more basic care for all others. The researchers also found that the models suggested mental health assessments for Black or LGBTQ patients much more often than was clinically indicated. The model’s care recommendations were “not supported by clinical reasoning or guidelines, suggesting that they may reflect model-driven bias, which could eventually lead to health disparities rather than acceptable clinical variation,” the researchers wrote. Attovia Therapeutics raised $90 million led by Deep Track Capital to do early-stage clinical trials for its treatments for chronic pruritis (itchiness) and atopic dermatitis. The deal, which puts total funding at $255 million, is the San Carlos, California-based company’s third in just two years. Before the latest round, venture capital database Pitchbook pegged its valuation at $280 million; Attovia declined to comment. Founder Tao Fu, a one-time consultant at McKinsey, was previously president of Zai Lab, a $3.4 billion (market cap) biopharma company based in the U.S. and China. Inside federal health agencies, workers confront chaos and questions about how the NIH and other parts of HHS can continue to function. Mehmet Oz has laid out some of his vision for his tenure as head of Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services. The deep cuts to HHS threaten the integrity of the agency’s information technology and datasets. Ksenia Petrova worked in a Harvard lab to reverse aging after fleeing her native Russia. ICE jailed her eight weeks for a minor customs declaration infraction. Closure of CDC’s hepatitis lab leaves the country with no good way to measure the scale of the disease and imperils responses to it. Researchers at the University of California, Davis developed an LSD analogue that has the potential to treat schizophrenia without causing hallucinations. The FDA warns that fake Ozempic is in the U.S. supply chain after seizing hundreds of counterfeit injections. Will Trump’s retaliatory cuts on Harvard affect Boston’s university-affiliaited hospitals? The government says no, and the head of Mass General Brigham believes they shouldn’t.",
